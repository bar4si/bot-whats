## 🚀 Key Features

### 🌐 Concurrent Multi-Bot Architecture
Unlike standard bots, AI-Fred initializes all your WhatsApp sessions **in parallel** on startup. Every bot remains active and responsive in the background while you navigate the dashboard.

### 📊 Global Dashboard & Monitoring
A central command center for all your instances:
- **Live Status:** Monitor bots as they transition between `Waiting for QR`, `Loading`, and `Online`.
- **Real-time Stats:** See contact and message counts for every bot at a glance.
- **Dynamic Refresh:** Press `ENTER` to instantly update the status of all concurrent bots.

### 🛠️ Professional Administrative CLI
Detailed management for each specific instance:
1. **Contact Indexing:** List all registered contacts with names and JIDs.
2. **Conversation History:** View recent messages with bot/user differentiation.
3. **Connection Status:** In-depth technical info about the current session.
4. **Context Switching:** Navigate back to the Global Dashboard without stopping the bot (Option 9).
5. **Session Management:** Easily create new sessions (Option N) or delete old ones (Option D) with full data wipe.

### 🛡️ Anti-Ban & Intelligent UI
- **Per-Bot Privacy:** Toggle **Public** or **Private** (Admin Only) modes independently for each bot.
- **Humanized Presence:** Randomized response delays and simulated "typing..." indicators.
- **Data Isolation:** SQLite database stores data keyed by `bot_id`, ensuring no leaks between accounts.
